# Sunbase1-_Assigment1
Here ,I had analyzed the customer churn data provided by Sunbase data company and predicted who will be churned and who will be retained.

I had prepared a classification model which predicts the churn of the customers from given company.

--->Firstly,I had collected the data and done required preprocessing steps.

--->Then I had done EDA to know better about the data.

--->Prepared the data to apply ml techniques

---> Applied 5 types of ml classification algorithms like logistic, naive bayes, Randomforest , adaboost, decision tree and then done cross validation of ecah model and evaluated.

---> Finally , done the prediction based on the model which had given high accuracy .
